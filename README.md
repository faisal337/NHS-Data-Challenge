# NHS Digdata Challenge

This project was completed as part of the **NHS Digdata Challenge** and focuses on exploring and analyzing monthly antidepressant prescription data in the UK. The goal was to extract insights on national and regional trends, costs, and prescription volumes over time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand national and regional prescribing volumes and costs
- Analyze monthly and annual prescribing trends
- Identify the most and least prescribed drugs
- Examine regional patterns and disparities
- Predict future monthly antidepressant prescription volumes (optional)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **PowerPoint** (for presentation)
- NHS Open Data: [Prescription Cost Analysis Dataset](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/prescription-cost-analysis-pca-monthly-data)

## 🧪 Workflow Overview

### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Combined multi-year NHS PCA datasets  
- Cleaned column names, removed irrelevant rows, handled missing values

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Visualized annual and monthly trends  
- Filtered for top 10 antidepressants by quantity and cost  
- Grouped data by region and drug

### 3. Key Visualizations  
- National prescribing cost trend (2021–2024)  
- Most prescribed drug per year  
- Top 10 prescribed drugs by volume and cost  
- Regional prescription trends (North East, South West, East England, etc.)

### 4. Key Findings  
- **Sertraline hydrochloride** is the most prescribed antidepressant by both volume and total cost  
- **Venlafaxine** ranks high in cost despite relatively fewer prescriptions—indicating higher per-unit price  
- Several drugs (e.g., **Trimipramine**, **Vortioxetine**) are costly but prescribed less frequently  
- **Trazodone**, **Paroxetine**, and **Escitalopram** are commonly prescribed but inexpensive  
- The **North East and Yorkshire** region leads in total prescription quantity  
- Monthly costs have **decreased** overall since 2021  
- All regions showed a consistent **annual increase in prescription volume**
